# Package *adapters*

Package *adapters* provides functionality of transforming the data that flows into the system or out of the system to/from the format most convenient for the external agent that wants its use case to be executed.

It can, for example, transform JSON formatted data coming from the HTTP API endpoint to the format expected by some use case, and then convert the data returned by the use case to the JSON formatted response object.
